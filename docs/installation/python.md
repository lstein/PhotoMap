# Installing Python

You will need Python version 3.10 or higher. To determine if Python is already installed on your system, open up a command shell (Powershell or COM shell on Windows, Terminal on MacOS/Linux) and type:

```bash
python -V
```

If the command responds with `Python 3.10.0` or higher you are good to go. Otherwise, go to [www.python.org](http://www.python.org), follow the download link, and install the version appropriate for your hardware and operating system.

**Important message for Windows users**: When you run the Python installer, the installer has a checkbox to add python to your PATH. Please be sure to enable this! If you miss it the first time, run the installer again and make sure the checkbox is checked.

After running the installer, run `python -V` again to confirm that it is installed and active.
